This ia a project i have done during my internship to learn about the basics of Spring Boot framework.
In this project i have set up a spring boot application that uses spring scurtiy, thymeleaf, html, slf4j, and other technologies.
This application is a basic login and registration page which can be implemented on any website and 
it also shows the users who have already registered and the applications uses mysql to store the details of the users. The password is hashed and then stored in the DB.
